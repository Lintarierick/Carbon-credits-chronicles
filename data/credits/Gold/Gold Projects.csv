Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewablesâ€™ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de lâ€™ElectricitÃ© et de lâ€™Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the countryâ€™s energy dependence vis-Ã -vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Moroccoâ€™s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the projectâ€™s contribution to Moroccoâ€™s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:â€¢Diversification of the national supply of energy;â€¢Project in line with the Moroccan governmentâ€™s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nationâ€™s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .â€¢Local development of renewable energy usage;â€¢Reduction of the countryâ€™s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;â€¢Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;â€¢Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;â€¢Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;â€¢Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the projectâ€™s operation phase. Estimated project start date: February 2018",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of non-renewable woody biomass contributes to deforestation and emits a lot of toxic smoke. Gas represents an alternative energy to the use of woody biomass for the cooking needs of households and street food vendors. Promoting the use of this energy therefore makes it possible to transfer household energy demand to another fuel, thus easing the pressure on the vegetation cover. In addition, gas cooking significantly reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) and fine particle emissions, thus contributing to the fight against climate change. Gas cooking also has a health impact, as it considerably reduces the inhalation of harmful fumes by users, while providing incomparable cooking comfort.

This is achieved through the installation and operation of solar PV systems replacing fossil fuel-powered equipment._x000D_
Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of the Moroccan economy. In many areas, precipitation levels are low, meaning that agricultural activity can only be sustained through irrigation. Inefficient pumping and irrigation systems have contributed to the decline of groundwater levels in Morocco, threatening soil fertility. Farmers without access to grid electricity usually power their pumping systems with diesel and butane gas, which they often source over long distances. Furthermore, they are dependant on fossil fuel prices._x000D_
This project allows farmers to become independant of fossil fuels through the hire purchase of a PV system, which they pay off over a period of 6 years. This does not create extra costs for farmers but instead saves them money, as they no longer need to purchase fuel. In order to obtain a PV system through this project, farmers are required to switch to a water-efficient drip irrigation system.

The Program addresses two drivers for inhouse pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based lamp devices with solar energy technology as well as inefficient stoves with more energy efficient cook stoves. These will be distributed to households and small holders in the project region, thereby helping to reduce fuel costs and risks for diseases in the respiratory systems and the eyes. Further tens of millions of schoolchildren in Africa cannot study after dark because they live without electricity. After school, children often help their families with household chores and agricultural tasks and once they turn their attention to homework, their neighbourhoods and villages are in almost complete darkness. By the distribution of solar lamps to school children this program will contribute to expanding study hours to night-time and reduces costs of unhealthy sources of light. As the project targets the improvement of livelihood in households this project targets as well the traditional cooking methods which are often inefficient, dangerous, and harmful to the environment. The Programme aims at providing especially women with improved stoves that improve health, safe time, firewood, and money. The stoves aim at reducing 50% of the timber used so less time is spent in gathering firewood, a task traditionally carried out by children and women that takes up to 20 hours a week. The new stove also emits less smoke and will result in less eye and respiratory diseases It is the aim of the program to support local developers of clean cook stoves in order to support their development and support technology that is reflecting the needs and was approved by local communities. The project scope is including, but not limited to the distribution of solar lamps for school kids, household solar PV applications, solar water pumps, and clean cookstove technologies.

The project ICS combust biomass fuels more efficiently, reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate matter (PM) emissions, improving indoor air quality in project households/SMEs. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the traditional/baseline stoves, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs. _x000D_
In the absence of the proposed PoA, inefficient traditional / 3-stone fires /charcoal pots would have been used for cooking. Thus, replacement of the baseline inefficient stoves with project ICS shall reduce non-renewable biomass fuel consumption and hence equivalent amount of GHG emissions. _x000D_

The purpose of the project is to replace the commonly used inefficient wood fired mud stoves technology, with clean, sustainable and efficient biogas. Each household utilizes cow dung to feed the digester for the production of biogas for cooking purpose and heating water. This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil conditions in rural areas.

The PoA aims to replace traditional stoves with high efficient cooking devices, which would deliver impact across multiple areas._x000D_
Cooking on inefficient cooking devices using biomass, is a global problem affecting health, productivity and the environment. A large part of the PoA boundary population cannot use modern fuels such as electricity or cooking gas on account of access, affordability and availability.  _x000D_
Inefficient cooking devices consume significant amounts of fuel and emit dangerous smoke on account of their incomplete and inefficient combustion. The smoke emitted by traditional stoves is known to be one of the biggest health risks faced by women and children due to the presence of particulates._x000D_
For this reason, this proposed PoA aims at reducing the wood fuel consumption of inefficient cooking devices by distributing improved cook devices which reduce fuel consumption. To reduce deforestation and the emission of greenhouse gas within the PoA boundary, cooking devices being distributed will lead to use of less wood fuel or substitute it._x000D_
The PoA proposes to develop and commercialise the carbon assets from the distribution of various cooking devices (improved cook stoves, ethanol stoves, electric cookers, metered LPG, solar cookers amongst others) to replace baseline inefficient stoves.  The PoA will structured in away such that it can leverage on investor funding and carbon finance to support (subsidy) production and distribution. The investor funds would be supplemented with Carbon funds which will create a revolving fund to help in payment for the cooking devices and provide a loan facility to help more uptake of the cooking devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

_x000D_
The project ICS combust biomass fuels more efficiently, reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and particulate emissions (PM), thus improving the indoor air quality in project households. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the 3-stone fires, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs._x000D_
_x000D_
In the absence of the proposed VPA, inefficient 3-stone fires are used for cooking and their replacement with project ICS reduces non-renewable biomass fuel consumption, saving greenhouse gas emissions._x000D_
_x000D_
At the time of VPA inclusion, there are 45,000 ICS planned for distribution under the VPA, of which c. 35,000 have been distributed and entered into the monitoring database. It is anticipated that the remaining ICS will be distributed by April 2021.",11009.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

The integration model will help communities in the project area to have access to clean energy, promote sustainable forestry management, food security and climate resilient communities. This model will help promote access to renewable energy technologies as enshrined in the National Policy on Climate Change (2016). The project beneficiaries are encouraged to participate in tree planting activities, practicing sustainable farming methods and forest resources management.
The solar cooker project will supplement governmentâ€™s efforts to counter the adverse impacts
of climate change and contribute to building climate resilience in vulnerable communities by providing access to renewable sources of energy.

This will be achieved through distribution and installation of LPG units that are connected to a smart meter to track and monitor LPG usage by the end-users. The programme adapts a Pay as You Go (PAYG) approach to accelerate access to LPG by the end-users. The PoA also aims to contribute towards sustainable development goals. The specific description of the PoA is as follows:_x000D_
a)	The PoA entails distribution and installation of Pay as You Go LPG units that are made distinct by the unique smart meter developed by Circle Gas._x000D_
b)	The project developer will have the formal responsibility of the PoA and will be directly responsible for maintaining the sales record, collecting baseline information, and the annual monitoring process. _x000D_
c)	The PoA is a voluntary action by the project developer. _x000D_
d)	The goal of the project is to increase access to LPG especially among low-income households which will significantly reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with use of traditional unsustainable fuels such as wood, charcoal, and kerosene._x000D_
The PoA aims to replace traditional biomass (fuelwood and charcoal), and kerosene cookstoves with LPG units, which will deliver impacts across the following multiple areas:_x000D_
_x000D_
Improved health: Using LPG reduces the use of dirty fuels such as firewood, charcoal and kerosene which disproportionately impacts on women and children due to smoke and other indoor air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. LPG is a safe fuel that will lead to significant improvement in indoor air quality in beneficiary households (SDG 3).  _x000D_
â€¢	Environment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass and kerosene stoves consumes more fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Using LPG reduces CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13)._x000D_
â€¢	Gender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional biomass inefficient stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The project technology is efficient and saves on householdsâ€™ time since there is no need for collecting wood and cooking time is shortened. This leads to improved use of time at home especially for women who can venture in other income generating activities and give children more time for study (SDG 4 & 5)._x000D_
â€¢	Money and Time savings: Families spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy provision. The Circle Gas target market is the urban low-income population. Using the technology provides meaningful savings for customers while creating thousands of high-quality jobs (SDG 1)._x000D_
â€¢	Affordable and Clean Energy: Affordable energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through implementation of this programme (SDG 7)._x000D_

This will be achieved through distribution and installation of LPG units that are fitted with a smart meter to track and monitor LPG usage by the end-users. The project adopts a Pay as You Go (PAYG) approach to accelerate access to LPG by the end-users. The project acitivity also aims to contribute towards sustainable development goals. The specific description of the project activity is as follows:_x000D_
a)	The project entails distribution and installation of Pay as You Go LPG units that are made distinct by the unique smart meter developed by Circle Gas._x000D_
b)	The project developer is Circle Gas, who will have the formal responsibility of the Project activity._x000D_
c)	The VPA implementor for this project activity is M-Gas Kenya, and will be directly responsible for maintaining the sales database, collecting baseline information, and co-ordinating the annual monitoring process. _x000D_
d)	The project activity is a voluntary action by the project developer. _x000D_
e)	The goal of the project is to accelerate access to LPG especially among low-income households which will significantly reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with use of traditionally unsustainable fuels such as wood, charcoal, and kerosene._x000D_
_x000D_
The aim of the project activity is to replace traditional biomass (fuelwood and charcoal), and kerosene cookstoves used in the baseline, with LPG units which will deliver impacts across the following multiple areas:_x000D_
â€¢	Improved health: Using LPG reduces the use of dirty fuels such as firewood, charcoal and kerosene which disproportionately impacts on women and children due to smoke and other household air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. Household Air Pollution (HAP) is one of the largest health risk factors for mortality in Kenya with about 21,560 deaths attributed to HAP annually . Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of BC and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health (SDG 3).  _x000D_
â€¢	Environment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass and kerosene stoves consumes more fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of black carbon and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health.Using LPG reduces CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13)._x000D_
â€¢	Gender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional biomass inefficient stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls, and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The project technology is efficient and saves on householdsâ€™ time since there is no need for collecting wood and cooking time is shortened. This leads to improved use of time at home especially for women who can venture in other income generating activities and give children more time for study (SDG 4 & 5)._x000D_
â€¢	Money and Time savings: Families spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy provision. The Circle Gas target market is the urban low-income population. Using the technology provides meaningful savings for customers while creating thousands of high-quality jobs (SDG 1)._x000D_
â€¢	Affordable and Clean Energy: Affordable energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through implementation of this programme (SDG 7)._x000D_
â€¢	Job creation: the project will create employment to many people especially the youths who will be employed as field sales and service teams, and the overall management of the programme (SDG 8). _x000D_
_x000D_
The project boundary for the VPA is the Republic of Kenya. _x000D_
The legal ownership of the products generated belongs to Circle Gas. The end-users sign a carbon rights waiver form, at the time of installation of the Circle Gas LPG unit, which transfers the carbon rights to Circle Gas. ",11330.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, eighty-four (84) per cent of households use wood and charcoal on a daily basis. For that reason, there is a growing pressure on forests and the country currently looses 105,000 hectares of forested land every year according to the Ministry in charge of environmental issues (â€œMinistÃ¨re de lâ€™environnement et du dÃ©veloppement durable""). High efficiency improved cookstoves and gas stoves help fight deforestation by significantly reducing the demand for wood and charcoal, and thus contribute to a global reduction in GHG emissions from biomass combustion. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called Nafa Naana with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all. Nafa Naana takes place in the context of the National Plan for the Environment (PANE) established in 1991 by the Government of Burkina Faso, and is financially supported by the Ministry of Mines, Quarries and Energy. Nafa Naana  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distributes  more  efficient  charcoal and wood stoves,  LGP  stoves  and  solar  lanterns.  Nafa Naana is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. Financial services are offered to Nafa Naana clients either as group loans or individual loans to help  people  with  limited  financial  means  access those products. Finally, Nafa Naana is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as many energy products as possible in Burkina Faso. The project activity  â€œExpanding access to LPG in Burkina Faso through microfranchised distribution""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  wood  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fight  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  fumes  such  as  carbon  monoxide and PM 2.5 inside the homes of the beneficiary population. Indeed, the combustion of wood with traditional stoves releases toxic fumes in the air. These toxic fumes are one of the main causes of respiratory diseases among women and children.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cookstoves,  instead  of   traditional  ones,  means  that the  end  user  is  saving significant amounts of money because fuel expenses per gram of food cooked are lower for LPG than for wood when the wood is purchased by the user.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is made of clay with a hole fashioned in the side to allow air and fuel entry, with fixed pot rests on the top and is designed to burn fuelwood and crop residues. To date, it has had the most success in rural Malawi due to its affordability, accessibility and appropriateness considering local preferences for energy needs. 
The project is implemented in two phases. In a first phase 30,000 households under the Social Cash Transfer program of the Government of Malawi are provided with free stoves in the first 5 months of the project. The distribution is carried out by members of the communities carefully selected and trained for that purpose. In second phase at least 30,000 stoves are sold under the commercial model at market price. In addition to community meetings several marketing activities are organized to increase the adoption rate of the project stove. 
The proposed improved cook stove technology will create a positive impact on the environment and eligible for generating Gold Standard certified emission reduction units The revenue for the sale of certified credits will be used for project implementation and climate change interventions among the rural communities.

Displacement of less efficient traditional cooking stoves from kitchens will reduce exposure of the family members, specifically women, to the indoor air pollution and reduce drudgery related to firewood collection or cleaning of utensils. These benefits will help in saving of health expenses. Each ICS promoted under the VPA will reduce the consumption of non-renewable biomass thereby reducing emission of about 10,000 tCO2eq of greenhouse gases annually. Each stove disseminated under the project will have a useful life of five years and will potentially reduce the firewood consumption by more than half for comparable usages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Clean Energy LLC has wind farm a capacity of 49.6 MW and generate (net) 168.5 GWh of electricity per year.

On 25th June 2013, The Salkhit wind farm started commercial operation. The Salkhit wind farm generates renewable electricity using wind power resources and sells the generated output to the Central Energy System (CES, or the grid) on the basis of a power purchase agreement (PPA). In addition, the Salkhit wind farm also aims to lead renewable energy generation from wind in Mongolia, as the Salkhit wind farm was the first grid connected wind farm in Mongolia. The Salkhit wind farm generates greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by avoiding CO2 emissions from electricity generation by fossil fuel power plants that is supplied to Grid.

Thus, Salkhit wind farm installed capacity is 49.6 MW of renewable energy power generation and supplies to the Grid of 164 GWh of electricity generated from renewable energy annually.

A. Project scenario is the operation of 31 sets of wind turbines with a total capacity of 50MW which will supply an annual generation of 164GWh to grid and replace same amount of electricity generated by fossil fuel-fired power plants connected to grid. According to ACM0002 applied, the project is renewable electricity activity.
B. The baseline scenario of the project is the electricity supply of equal amount as the project from the grid. The baseline scenario of the project is the same as the scenario prior to the start of implementation of project activity.

The Project boundary included the project site and all power plants connected physically to the grid.

As the Grid is dominated by thermal power generation, the Salkhit wind farm activity is leading to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. The second crediting period for the proposed project is from 24/06/2020 to 23/06/2027 and estimated emission reduction is in the second crediting period are 1,332,835tCO2e. The average annual emission reduction is estimated by 190,405 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) for the 2nd crediting period.

Sustainable development
As the very first wind farm in Mongolia the Salkhit wind farm is greatly assisting the country in stimulating the commercialisation of grid-connected renewable energy technologies and markets. The Salkhit wind farm is helping to reduce GHG emissions versus the coal-dominated business-as-usual scenario. Furthermore, the Salkhit wind farm is improving air quality and local livelihoods and promote sustainable renewable energy industry development.
The specific goals of the project are to:
â€¢ generate electricity;
â€¢ help to stimulate the implementation of wind power in Mongolia;
â€¢ reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Mongolia compared to a business-as-usual scenario;
â€¢ create local employment opportunity during the assembly and installation of wind turbines, and for operation of the wind farm;

The project is focusing on smallholders to promote the development of circular economy (zero-waste livestock sector, organic fertilizer production, clean energy); contributing to improved biosecurity levels for small farm holders by treating waste; ensuring a strong role of the private sector involved in biogas technologies investment; promoting innovation in the biogas sector; and especially using carbon revenues as single source of project financing to become self-sustainable. 
The objectives of project: 
â€¢	To disseminate biodigester as a mitigating measure against the spread of diseases and ground and water pollution by treating livestock waste; to improve the quality of life of rural people in Vietnam. 
â€¢	Support the growth of the biogas market through capacity building and supporting suppliers of biogas products and services. 
â€¢	Reduce greenhouse gasses emissions to mitigate the adverse implication of global climate change. 

The project will support the construction/installation of at least 50,000 digesters in the rural area in Vietnam. All the installed biodigester which connected to indoor cooking facilities are received technical and operational assistance serving carbon credits management. Under the project, masons are trained and be able to deliver high quality biogas products and services. With implementation of this Project, annually, 159,672 tCO2e emissions will be reduced, not only from the displacement of non-renewable biomass (NRB) and fossil fuels currently used in stoves with clean and efficient biogas technology, but also by introducing a proper animal waste management system (AWMS).

This revolutionary concentrate, rich in copper and precious metals enjoys a low environmental footprint by bypassing the traditional mining channels and instead tapping into the ever-growing e-waste urban mine.
 
Igneo has perfected a simple yet exceptionally effective recycling and recovery solution to transform and enhance the vast quantities of valuable e-waste that are currently left untreated, unrecycled, and often abandoned in landfill. The Igneo process employs a multi-stage model which fully captures the economic value held in e-waste:
* Sourcing of electronic waste from traders, collectors and OEMs and identifying valuable key PCB (printed circuit board) and other metal containing material;
* Crushing and shredding the e-waste into a normalized fraction for further processing and sampling;
* The resulting shredded material is automatically sampled and then analyzed at on-site lab to determine the valuable metals contents;
* Using automated mechanical separation technology, remove the iron and aluminum from the shredded fraction;
* The shredded material is heat-treated using a pyrolyzing multi-hearth furnace, which convert organic matter into a gas state while retaining all metals. The result is a    homogeneous concentrate containing copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum etc. (copper concentrate);
* The off gas generated from the pyrolysis process is processed through several stages of gas remediation, including a post combustion chamber resulting in the mitigation or complete elimination of all toxic pollutants including dioxins, NOx gases and halogens.
 
The proprietary Igneo process converts and upgrades e-waste into a concentrate which is higher in valuable recoverable metal content than most other traditional copper concentrates and for the most part free of organic matter, sulfur, and toxic materials which are harmful or cost prohibitive to the copper smelting and refining processes. 

The estimated emissions savings per year are 32,000tCO2e, which accounts for 160,000tCO2e of the first crediting period 2023 - 2027.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Programme Coordinating Entity is the manufacturer of the advanced coating system, Azra Tech Inc.. The unique system is based on two main advanced underwater products family NPC 7001/7002 epoxy modified and  hull coating AFSil03 Plus, both modified by patented nanoclay nanotechnologies WO2010/064274 Anticorrosive Paint and coatings containing nanoparticles. 

The systems is a biocide free coating,   without silicon oil, without  heavy metal and other  pharmaceutical agents, giving high cross-linking coating density during applications, and exhibiting at the same time anti-corrosion protection, hydrophobic features, excellent adhesion and high mechanical strength. These properties are achieved through properly designing the surface chemical functionalization together with the requested surface physical texturing. 

The type of coating most commonly used on ships are: self-polishing copolymer (SPC) which slowly releases a biocidal antifouling agent (biocidal antifouling coatings contain bioactive materials intentionally added to control the growth of organisms) and foul release coating (FRC), based on silicone or fluorine compounds, most of them containing silicone oil or fluoropolymer oil, which can cause serious concern for the environment.

FRCs cannot inhibit the attachment of organisms, but the interfacial bond between organisms and the coating surface is weak due to their low surface free energy (SFE) so that the attached organisms can be readily removed by the water shear force coming from mechanical cleaning or the shipâ€™s navigation.

Traditional silicone-based FRCs have weak adhesion to substrates, low mechanical strength, and low anti-corrosion features.

Both silicone oil or fluoropolymer oil have a higher toxicity rating to the environment and humans compared to Azra Tech  systems. AFSIL products are totally biocide free, IMO certified,  with no silicon oil or fluorine materials and are substantially lower in toxicity compared to biocidal and silicon/fluorine based system.

The ethanol stove has a thermal efficiency of 65% and use only clean and renewable ethanol cooking fuel. The ethanol is denatured and colored in accordance with Kenyan law for ethanol cooking fuel

The ethanol used is a by-product from sugar factories.  Sugar factories ethanol from molasses, which is a by-product from sugar production.  Part of the ethanol is of sub-standard quality and this ethanol is then used as cooking fuel. Approximately 10 % of the ethanol produced by the sugar factories is of sub-standard quality and not suitable for human consumption.  These 10% of the ethanol produced in Kenya is sufficient for the ethanol cookstove projects as part of our PoA in Kenya. 

The project is fully funded by Samsung Electronics co., Ltd.   Samsung also buy the carbon Credits.

The OASIS Box is an all-in-one, solar-powered water filtration and storage unit, which offers up to 10,000 liters of 99.9999% contamination free water daily. See section A.3 for detailed breakdown of technology. Each OASIS Box will bring clean water to 100 households. Based on the average no. of people per household at 5, overall, this project has the capacity to bring clean water to up to 75,000 individuals in Nowshera. The project will be implemented in phases beginning with Phase 1: 10 OASIS Box deployments.  
Households in rural communities have limited resource to purify water, often resulting in consumption of dirty water. By and large, these communities often find themselves in a cycle of chronic illness which particularly impacts children and often leads to fatalities. In Pakistan alone, an estimated 53,000 children die annually from water-borne related disease (UNICEF). In addition, Pakistan still has strides to make in implementing green technology in the WASH sector. In the absence of national action, communities are extremely self-reliant and rely on conventional methods such as burning fuelwood to purify water. In the baseline scenario (per 100 households) an estimated following VERs are emitted from burning fuelwoods to purify water:  
330 ton CO2, 17.5 ton CH4 and 17.5 ton N2O
By deploying our units as a safe and sustainable alternative, project emissions are assumed to be zero given that our technology only utilizes solar energy, without access to a backup generator or connection to an electrical grid. In the project scenario, each unit is estimated to offset 360 VERs.

The Boja stoves will displace baseline inefficient cooking devices that consume more non-renewable biomass. From the applied methodology (Technologies and Practices to Displace Decentralized Thermal Energy Consumption, Version 4.0), the baseline scenario is the consumption of non-renewable biomass using inefficient devices for thermal energy needs as those provided by the project devices.

GS11725,Deployment of LPG Cookstoves in Kenya POA,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,Kenya,Large Scale,Listed,Methodology for Metered & Measured Energy Cooking Devices,0,PAYGO ENERGY INC,"7,13,3,5",POA,,,"PayGo is developing a large-scale program that will deploy LPG stoves in Kenya in order to reduce the demand for expensive and polluting fuels like wood, charcoal and kerosene. LPG has significantly less environmental impact than other available fuels due to its source, combustion byproducts and yield. LPG is safer to transport and use and is precisely controllable by end-users â€“ with known and consistent properties and minimal emissions of toxic byproducts. LPG does not emit soot (black carbon), smoke or dangerous fumes. The use of LPG stoves will be much more efficient than what is currently being used for cooking, thus requiring much fewer BTUs of fuel per meal. The result will be substantial reductions in both greenhouse gas and non-GHG pollution.

PayGoâ€™s approach will be to use a Cylinder Smart Meter (CSM) system that enables a â€œpay as you goâ€ service. The CSM contains a low-pressure LPG regulator, metering capabilities and a communications system. The product affixes to existing cylinder valves and enables customers to make small payments for LPG via the customerâ€™s mobile money account. To use PayGoâ€™s CSM, a customer need only have mobile money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Site has received non-hazardous solid municipal, industrial, commercial, institutional, and some agricultural wastes for approximately 20 years. Landfills normally emit carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere, with these compounds being generated by the anaerobic decomposition of the above-noted wastes placed at the project site. Prior to the implementation of the Project, the Manaus landfill was basically a landfill with has minimal control of surface water and leachate and no control of landfill gas (LFG).
The purpose of the project activity is to collect landfill gas (LFG) at the Manaus Landfill and to combust the extracted LFG over a seven year-period, using a high efficient enclosed flare, thereby generating electricity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). 
The project involved the construction of a LFG collection system consisting of horizontal trenches and vertical LFG extraction wells, centrifugal blower(s), and all other supporting mechanical and electrical subsystems and appurtenances necessary to collect the LFG.

The LFG collected from the site is combusted in an enclosed LFG flare with full process controls and instrumentation installed and operating. The state-of-the-art flare is capable of providing sufficient temperature and retention time of the extracted LFG for complete destruction of hydrocarbons.

In Ethiopia, a series of droughts, overgrazing, erosion as well as deforestation due to the need for construction and firewood have resulted in eroded and depleted soils. Therefore, the livelihood of the population, which lives predominantly from agriculture, is severely threatened. MfM has set up an array of integrated measures to counter the vicious circle for the smallholder population living in rural Ethiopia.
MfMâ€™s afforestation program aims at rehabilitating land through physical and biological natural resource management practices and by considering crucial livelihood enhancement measures. While various afforestation measures are being taken, at the same time, the program will improve the livelihood of the community living in the contemplable catchments. The participation of the community is considered crucial for the sustainability of all conducted activities. The program will result in verifiable CO2e emission reductions in line with the SDG 13 (among other positive impacts on SGDs). Set up as a Small-scale PoA the program will generate GS VERs during a 30 year crediting period by the certified removal of maximum 16,000 t CO2 per year in each VPA. 
The proposed afforestation activities will first take place in the administrative district Wogdi, South Wollo Zone of Amhara National Regional State, covering an area of about 1,100 km2 at a distance of 580 kms northeast from Addis Ababa via highway. Four real case VPAs areas are initially planned there on a project area of 510 ha. In the near future MfM plans to expand activities to include other VPAs to the PoA within Ethiopia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

developed by ATEC Australia-International Pty Ltd (ATEC*) with the purpose of replacing the use of highly polluting non-renewable and fossil fuels used for cooking by households within the project target areas. This will be achieved through the distribution and installation of ATEC PAYGO enabled eCook induction cookstoves. ATECâ€™s patented electric cookstove (eCook) is the worldâ€™s first Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) induction stove which is ATECâ€™s flagship product that brings 27 months ranged PAYGO facility, Global System for Mobile (GSM) Communications and Internet of Things (IoT) functionality that makes mobile money payments easy for unbanked and underserved populations. 
The primary target are end-users who cook using polluting fuels in inefficient stoves in the baseline, yet are already connected to the grid. The use of electricity for cooking using highly efficient cooking appliances is expected to provide an affordable, convenient, and safe cooking solution to end-users. The program will also contribute towards sustainable development goals key among them being SDG 1,3,7 and 13. The first project activities are being implemented in Bangladesh and Cambodia.
The specific description of the Program of Activity is as follows:
a)	The Program of Activities (PoA) entails the distribution of an e-cooking solution among households especially those using biomass for cooking yet are connected to the grid. 
b)	The PoA is being developed and implemented by ATEC*, who will have the formal responsibility of coordinating the PoA and the included VPAs.
c)	ATEC* will work with local project implementers who will provide support in the management of the VPAs in respective countries. 
d)	The PoA is a voluntary action by the project developer and will apply the Methodology for Metered & Measured Energy Cooking Devices in the calculation of emission reductions. 
The project will have social, economic, and environmental benefits and impacts across the following multiple areas:
â€¢	Improved health: Using e-cooking solutions reduces the use of polluting fuels such as firewood, charcoal, and kerosene which disproportionately impacts women and children due to smoke and other household in-door air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. E-cooking provides a clean, safe and reliable cooking solution that will lead to significant improvement in indoor air quality in beneficiary households (SDG 3).
â€¢	Environment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass stoves consumes a lot of fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Using electricity for cooking will reduce CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13).
â€¢	Gender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional inefficient biomass stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to the constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls, and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The e-cooking technology being promoted by the project developer is efficient and saves on householdsâ€™ time since there is no need for collecting wood, and the cooking time is shortened. This leads to productive use of time at home, especially for women who can venture into other income-generating activities and improve the quality of study time for children (SDG 4 & 5).
â€¢	Money and Time savings: Most families using biomass fuels and kerosene for cooking spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy needs. ATEC seeks to target households who are connected to the grid but using biomass and kerosene for cooking, in the distribution of the units. Using the technology will provide meaningful time and money savings for these end-users (SDG 1).
â€¢	Affordable and Clean Energy: Affordable clean energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through the e-cooking technology being promoted by the program (SDG 7).
â€¢	Job creation: The program will create employment opportunities for many people in different phases of the program. These are expected to benefit locals and especially the youths who will be employed as part of sales and service teams, and the overall management of the program (SDG 8).

Taiwan is a biologically diversified island, in the past agriculture as the main production, now is dominated by high-tech, semiconductor and other industries, Taiwan still has millions of small farmers, responsible for the supply of 236 million Taiwanese main grain and small part of the export. Taiwan itself is an island with the earth's plates collided up, located on the Tropic of Cancer, with a land area of 36,000 square kilometers, 268 high mountains of more than 3,000 meters, high mountains and rapid rivers and streams, natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, heavy rainstorms, landslides, the soil is relatively poor, the soil lack of organic matters, the introduction of conventional agriculture for more than half a century, a large number of farmland soil acidified, lack of organic matter is common situation.

The use of the Gold Standard Global Goalâ€™s Soil Organic Carbon Framework Methodology for Small Farmersâ€™ Carbon Farming is able to encourage Taiwan's governments and farmers to adopt more environmentally sound, soil, food security, healthy farming practices for farmers and consumers, and more importantly, participate in global climate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It also motivates small farmers in action on the 17 goals of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Agricultural carbon sequestration, as if it is very important for small farmers to participate in global climate action, but small farmers lack resources, including finance, knowledge and experience, it is not easy to record, declare their working logs, so that the evidence of greenhouse gas emission reduction certification is difficult to be demonstrated. 

The Project Developer, the Eco-Affinity Inc., specially offers a set of smart phone applications for small farmers to do carbon farming called â€œMiHuMISangâ€ adopted from  greetings of indigenous Bunun Tribe.  

Since smart phone, social media applications are popular, as long as farmers have the experience of taking photos, checking-in, post photos to share. Â It is easy for small farmers to record their carbon project activities through encryption technology, the authentic photo files bundle with time stamps and geotags spontaneously that cannot be adulterated once they are uploaded to the database to form systematic big data to help small farmers achieve certification quality assurance and quality control (product and process QA/QC), and except personal confidential information, all data will be made public on the Internet for public participation and witness. Â VVB is also easy to trace back to verify project activities, increase the credibility of certification, and preventing carbon leakage, double counting loopholes, and produce high-quality VERs.

This will not only apply to Taiwan, but also to small farmers around the world in the future, to promote more farmers and consumers to participate in climate action and achieve the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

Subsequently, during the colonization of East Panama (CaÃ±itas-TortÃ­ 1970's and 1980's), the lands have been deforested and gradually degraded by repetitive slash-and-burn processes and conversion to pasture.
At the time of reforestation, the vegetation cover of the farms includes wooded pastures with native and improved grasses, as well as areas of stubble mostly in their different stages of development between 1-5 years of age. The only economic activity has been extensive cattle ranching in pasture areas. 
Furthermore, the project aims to improve the livelihoods of local populations, in special regards to women head-of-family, by incrementing their participation in the activities. The tree nurseries, a central piece to the plantations, aims to hire only women under this description, providing also training in several areas to ensure a stable income and tangible professional progression. 
The project is also committed to the conservation of endangered wildlife. There is evidence that the project area is transverse by wild fauna currently part of the IUCN Red List, collected by using trap cameras. The aim of the carbon certification is to create conditions to expand the program to monitor this wildlife as part of the conservation effort. The project may assume additional activities to improve the wildlife presence in the area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These devices release all the combustion smoke and particles into the kitchen of a house because they donâ€™t have any outlet for combustion gases. The improved cook stove discharges the smoke into the environment outside the house and reduces the indoor air pollution substantially. Chronic diseases and burning accidents are reduced considerably as an effect of the installations. The greater efficiency of an improved cook stove causes a reduction in the consumption of firewood and saves non-renewable biomass and emission of green house gases. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project will last 5 years and will be renewable twice, for a maximum period of 15 years.

The project's cookstove model is a metal-ceramic fireplace using wood. 

The benefits will be both environmental and social. On the social front, the project will create jobs, reduce smoke emissions including smoke inhalation diseases, and reduce the time spent cooking and collecting biomass because the project's cooking stove needs less biomass to function. From an environmental point of view, the project will reduce the impact on the forest by reducing wood collection and thus avoid carbon emissions.

The objective of this improved cookstove project is therefore to improve the health and well-being of households, mainly women and children in the project area, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions released by traditional cooking and water boiling activities. 
The owner of the project is APEDD, a Guinean NGO (Association of Women for Development) that promotes women's empowerment and environmental protection.
The standard chosen for this project is the Gold Standard and the methodology applied is the TPDDTEC (Technologies and Practices for Moving Decentralized Thermal Energy Consumption) V3.1.

It is intended that under this project high thermal efficient cook stoves will be distributed. The ICS distributed will burn wood more efficiently thereby improving thermal transfer to pots, hence saving fuel wood. This project will also halt the rapidly progressing deforestation in India but will also reduce health hazards from indoor smoke pollution and women and children will have to spend less time collecting firewood.
The target population is the rural population of India, those uses three stone fires cook stove and cannot afford these stoves, project participant has to heavily subsidize it or give it off free of cost. The end user will be informed in advance that the use of ICS generates carbon finance which in turn is used to cover the price of ICS and for recovering project implementation costs.

The project activity will result in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction from the CTL landfill through the ways below:
- Burning CH4 in flares and/or group generators (implemented and running);
- Supply consumers through a dedicated pipeline (implemented and running);
- The amount of electricity generated in the project activity will be part used for self-consumption at CTL landfill facilities and the surplus part will be exported to the Brazilian national grid, avoiding the dispatch of an equal amount of energy produced by fossil fueled thermal plants to that grid. The initiative avoids CO2 emissions and contributes to the regional and national sustainable development (not implemented yet, but already included in the CDM Project).
It is important to highlight that currently the energetic use of the biogas in the project activity is through the selling of LFG to consumers (dedicated pipeline) and those consumers generates electricity to the grid.

It is expected that, when the project becomes fully operational, will displace fossil fuel fired power stations avoiding the emission of 316,417 tCO2 each year and 1,936,963 tCO2 during the first crediting period. 
As the project activity is a greenfield renewable energy power plant, the scenario existing prior its implementation is a semi-desert, sparse vegetated, coastal winded pasture and shrub land, where neither facilities nor crops existed previously.
According to the ACM0002, as the project activity is the installation of a new grid-connected renewable power plant, the baseline scenario is the â€œelectricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the â€œTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity systemâ€.

SEMPLIFICATA,"7,8,13",VPA,,,"The proposed Voluntary Project Activity (VPA) consists of installing and operating a new grid-connected Solar Photovoltaic (PV) power plant, at a site where no renewable power plant was operating prior to its implementation (green-field plant). Esperanza power plant will be located in the Esperanza municipality, province of Valverde in the Dominican Republic.

Esperanza power plant will have an installed capacity of 90 MW  and involves the installation and construction of the following components: photovoltaic solar panels on embedded metal structures, three-phase inverters, transformers, medium and high voltage electrical networks, electrical substation, warehouse, administrative and control buildings, access roads, internal roads and platforms, parking lots, green areas, among others. In addition, it will have all the facilities for this type of project such as drinking water system, domestic wastewater system, system for the management and disposal of solid waste during the construction and operation stages of the project.
The energy that will be generated by the proposed project activity is currently dispatched by other grid-connected power plants. Hence, the baseline scenario and the scenario prior to project implementation are the same and in the absence of the proposed project, the electricity would have been generated by national grid connected plants, which includes fossil fueled power sources.
The project aims to provide clean, renewable, reliable, and sustainable energy to the National Interconnected Electrical System (SENI ) of the Dominican Republic. It will help in meeting the increasing demand for energy to bolster the nationâ€™s expanding economy. By harnessing solar energy, an abundant renewable energy resource in the country, the project will not just provide clean energy to the national grid but will also reduce the high dependence on imported fossil fuels. In addition, the project will contribute towards bridging the gap between demand and supply of power and therefore, strengthening the national energy security. By generating an annual average of 198 312 MWh/y, the project is expected to reduce an average of 123 271 tCO2e of emissions annually, contributing to SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). The project will also contribute to SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) by providing equal work opportunities to all, irrespective of discrimination on any basis.

The systems is a biocide free coating, without silicon oil, without heavy metal and other pharmaceutical agents, giving high cross-linking coating density during applications, and exhibiting at the same time anti-corrosion protection, hydrophobic features, excellent adhesion and high mechanical strength. These properties are achieved through properly designing the surface chemical functionalization together with the requested surface physical texturing. The type of coating most commonly used on ships are: self-polishing copolymer (SPC) which slowly releases a biocidal antifouling agent (biocidal antifouling coatings contain bioactive materials intentionally added to control the growth of organisms) and foul release coating (FRC), based on silicone or fluorine compounds, most of them containing silicone oil or fluoropolymer oil, which can cause serious concern for the environment. FRCs cannot inhibit the attachment of organisms, but the interfacial bond between organisms and the coating surface is weak due to their low surface free energy (SFE) so that the attached organisms can be readily removed by the water shear force coming from mechanical cleaning or the shipâ€™s navigation. Traditional silicone-based FRCs have weak adhesion to substrates, low mechanical strength, and low anti-corrosion features. Both silicone oil or fluoropolymer oil have a higher toxicity rating to the environment and humans compared to Azra Tech systems. AFSIL products are totally biocide free, IMO certified, with no silicon oil or fluorine materials and are substantially lower in toxicity compared to biocidal and silicon/fluorine based system.

Biomass, principally firewood and charcoal, holds huge importance in developing countries, accounting for a significant proportion of energy consumption. Biomass is often the predominant source of energy for cooking and water boiling, especially in rural areas. Cooking and water boiling are generally carried out on thermally inefficient traditional devices and produce large amounts of smoke and indoor air pollution.
The distribution of safe water supply and treatment technologies in this PoA will significantly reduce fuel consumption, resulting in an improved living environment for recipients, and reduced pressure on local forests. By reducing fuel consumption, CO2 emissions from combustion of non-renewable biomass will be correspondingly reduced.

Around 30% of Lao population lacks access to a source of improved drinking water and are at risk of getting diarrhoea or other water borne diseases. Though, a significant fraction of Lao population treats water preferable by boiling using woody biomass, charcoal etc to make the water safe for drinking. There is a significant fraction of families even cannot afford firewood to boil water, hence are forced to continue to drink unsafe water._x000D_
TerraClear is a social enterprise, registered as a private limited company under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The enterprise is in the business of getting clean water to more people in Laos by selling the Lao Ceramic Water Purifier (CWP) to the population. CWPâ€™s help people access safe drinking water, especially in rural areas, reduce time spent provisioning drinking water or collecting wood, reduce costs for families, reduce child and adult morbidity and mortality, improving attendance at school and increased productivity. Ceramic Water Purifiers provide for removal of microorganisms from water by gravity filtration through porous ceramics, with a typical flow rate at production of 1.5 - 3 litres per hour. â€¨Originally TerraClear plans to sell over 100,000 CWPâ€™s between 2012 and 2019 but this target seems a bit high as up to mid-2018, the total sale is just about 58,000 filters. It is estimated that by the end of its first crediting period (15th July 2019), the total sale would be about 67,000 CWPs._x000D_

With the new target, CWPs will provide safe drinking water for potentially more than 0.3 million people, and at the same time reduce the demand for water treatment through boiling water with non- renewable biomass. The CWPâ€™s have a useful life of 5 years or more provided proper care and maintenance. The Lao Ceramic Water Purifiers are manufactured locally in Laos and therefore contribute to building a local industry and value added in Laos, as well as creating much needed sustainable jobs and business opportunities in rural areas. The project start date is 06/06/2012. â€¨With the assistance of carbon finance, TerraClear can become a unique and on-going sustainable enterprise capable of providing emissions-free household water treatment options to rural households, and thereby improve public health, household welfare and economy, as well as contribute to reduced deforestation in Lao PDR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PoA will provide access to clean drinking water, which will reduce cost for families and thereby reduce child and adult morbidity and mortality, improve attendance at school, increase productivity, and more generally give a sense of hope and opportunity. Micro-entrepreneurs: low greenhouse gas emitting water purification technologies offer scope for micro-entrepreneurs, thereby creating jobs and supporting families.Economic sustainability and expansion: under this program, there is a direct incentive to ensure that the projects are successful, in that these same projects serve to fund further development. There is no disconnecting between funding and public health outcomes. b)Health benefitsImproved indoor quality: polluted indoor air due to open and uncontrolled combustion is a huge health concern in many developing countries. Low greenhouse gas emitting water disinfection technologies tackle this problem by reducing the combustion of wood/fossil fuels.Improved water: Almost a billion people lack access to safe drinking water. Water-borne disease is a leading cause of illness in the developing world, contributing to the death of two million children every year, on average. Providing safe drinking water to additional households/communities will have a significant impact on child mortality. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target aims to halve the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking-water. Strides have been made in improving access to safe drinking water and the world is projected to exceed this target. Nevertheless, by 2015, there will still be 672 million people who will not have access to improved drinking water. Furthermore, many more drink water that qualifies as improved but is nevertheless contaminated and poses health risks. (WHO, 2007; WHO and UNICEF, 2010)Improved indoor quality: polluted indoor air due to open and uncontrolled combustion is a huge health concern in many developing countries.

ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.",4534.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

GS2564,Expanding access to LPG in Haiti through microfinance services,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,Haiti,Small Scale,Gold Standard Certified Project,GS TPDDTEC v 1.,8623,Entrepreneurs du Monde,"13,3,15",Standalone,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/436,https://registry.goldstandard.org/projects/details/420,"In Haiti more than 90% of the population cooks on charcoal-based stoves and do so using so called traditional ones. Such stoves are considered non-efficient and require large amount of charcoal to operate which translate into a significant cost for the user. More than 1.4 million tons of charcoal is this way used each year.  This  over-consumption  is  not  sustainable  and  is  an  important  reason  behind  the  acute deforestation and soil erosion problems found in this country. On top of that, emissions of greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of charcoal, significantly participate to the global problem that is climate change. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called PALMIS EnÃ¨ji with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all.  This  program  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distribute  more  efficient  charcoal cookstoves,  LGP  cookstoves  and  solar  lanterns.  PALMIS EnÃ¨ji is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. A new microcredit financial product is also  being  developed  with  the  support  of  ID  Microfinance  (a  local  microfinance  institution  and  also  a program  of  Entrepreneurs  du  Monde)  to  help  people  with  limited  financial  means  to  have  to  access  to those products. Finally, PALMIS EnÃ¨ji is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as much as possible energy products in Haiti. The project activity  â€œExpanding LPG access in Haiti through microfinance services""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  charcoal  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fighting  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  gas  such  as  carbon  monoxide  inside households. Indeed, the combustion of charcoal with traditional stoves, generates toxic gas in the air.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cook stove,  instead  of  a  traditional  one,  means  the  end  user  is  saving significant amount of money because less fuel is needed for her/his cooking needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mahasakthi Cooperative Federation encourages independent, sustainable and viable alternative economic institutions of women focussing on womenâ€™s leadership, their legal rights and political empowerment. The purpose of the project activity is to set up 6,000 biogas plants (digesters) of 2m3 capacity each for single households having minimum of two cows and place to build biogas digester in four Mandals of Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, and in this way replace Non-Renewable Biomass with biogas for cooking and heating water. A biogas plant of 2 m3 capacity is sufficient to provide cooking fuel to a family of four to five . Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh State is a biomass deficit region . Fuel wood scarcity has an impact directly on rural households, which are highly dependent on this fuel. Demand for fuel wood and logs from commons and forests have caused resource degradation to the extent that collection exceeds sustainable yield. Forest degradation on the other hand leads to fuel wood scarcity leading to unsustainable removal of biomass to meet the demands. The project activity will attenuate the rural thermal energy needs used for cooking and water heating. Each household will install a 2 m3 biogas plant and cattle dung will be put into the anaerobic digester (Deenabandhu biogas Model). The technology is tried and tested in India , and has been in use for many years. By utilizing this cattle dung in a controlled anaerobic digestion and combustion system, biogas will be available for cooking energy and heating water. Biogas will be used on a two-ring gas stove having 4 inch burner, with a flame temperature of 870oC , supplied as part of the project activity. Implementation of the project depends on the successful validation and registration as a CDM project activity since the project will be financed completely from carbon revenues. After the project is registered as a CDM activity, carbon forward funding will enable the construction of domestic bio-digesters. An end user agreement will be signed between the PP, the Mahasakthi MAC Samakhya Ltd and the end user after construction, wherein the end user is aware of emission reductions from the use of biogas, and are willing to give up their rights and transfer the credit ownership to the Project Proponent, the Mahasakthi MAC Samakhya Ltd. Each household will feed cattle dung into the anaerobic digester which is a renewable source.

Grid connected renewable electricity generation,18768,Senok Wind Power (Pvt) Ltd.,"7,8,13",Standalone,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/524,https://registry.goldstandard.org/projects/details/506,"The purpose of the project activity is to use the wind energy potential in the North West coastal belt of Sri Lanka to produce a total of 10 MW using eight wind turbines, each rated at 1.25 MW. The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lankaâ€™s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri. Several community service initiatives are being implemented by the project participant. Estimated project start date: 23/08/2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total capacity of 2.80 MW will be installed, composed by 2 engines with individual capacity of 1.4 MW each. The project is expected to export 354,968  MWh during its lifetime.UberlÃ¢ndia Landfill comprises two adjoining solid waste disposal sites (SWDS), named Landfill I and Landfill II, both owned and operated by LimpebrÃ¡s ResÃ­duos Ltda. (Project Participant). The Landfill I started operating in July of 1995 and stopped receiving waste in September 2010. The Landfill II started operating in October 2010 with the same environmental care applied to the previous disposal site and counts on a qualified and multidisciplinary team of technicians. The landfill has a total area of 300,000 m2, with 200,000 m2 dedicated to disposal of waste, being able to receive till 4,500,000 m3 of solid waste for an approximately 18 years of lifetime. All the area was sealed with a membrane of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and compacted clay in order to protect the phreatic layer from contamination. The leachate generated in each landfill is given a different treatment. For Landfill I the leachate is treated at an ascendant flow anaerobic reactor followed by an anaerobic filter and then sent to the Uberabinhaâ€™s sewage treatment station (ETE Uberabinha) through municipal canalization. The leachate from Landfill II, after being analysed by the Municipal Department of Water and Sewage (Departamento Municipal de Ãgua e Esgoto â€“ DMAE), was authorized to be directly sent to the ETE Uberabinha without previous treatment. In this Project the Landfill I and the Landfill II were considered as a sole SDWS, since the area surrounding the two sites, including them, is owned and operated by LimpebrÃ¡s ResÃ­duos Ltda. and they are physically near enough to permit the joint operation. In fact, only a 27 m width road used exclusively for the landfilling operation separates the two sites, and the gas station and power plant of the proposed project activity are planned to be installed on the roadside between the Landfill I and Landfill II. Therefore, the estimative of emissions of methane from SWDS considered the two sites as one single SWDS.The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the UberlÃ¢ndia landfills I and II project activity at the UberlÃ¢ndia Landfill is the operation of the landfill with uncontrolled emission of the LFG (landfill gas) generated to the atmosphere, i.e. the LFG generated due to the decomposition of the organic matter is vented through the vertical wells installed at the landfillâ€™s area. As will be demonstrated ahead, the existing scenario and the baseline scenario are the same.Emissions associated with the baseline scenario are the CH4 emissions due to the atmospheric release of the LFG and CO2 emissions due to the power generation from fossil-fuel power-plants. With the implementation of the project, the LFG previously released will be collected through the installation of pipelines and emission reduction will be achieved through the destruction of the gas collected in a flaring system and in the power plant. Additionally, the project will export renewable electricity to the grid, avoiding the dispatch of the same amount of electricity from fossil-fuel based power plants in the Brazilian National Grid.The project will bring benefits to sustainable development, as follows:-Increase of local environmental quality: the project will contribute not only through the avoidance of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, but also by displacing the fossil fuel consumption from power plants connected to the Brazilian Electric Grid. The project might also be seen as a good practice of correct solid waste final disposal;-Labour capaciting / Income generation: the project will need qualified operators to maintain the gas collection wells and pipeline and to operate the degassing station and the power plant. A team composed by engineers and technicians will be created and trained by international consultants and manufacturers. The revenues of these personnel will be above the market, as the technology employed is new in the UberlÃ¢ndia region;-Integration with different sectors: using LFG to generate electricity is relatively new in Brazil â€“ some projects were developed only under the CDM and only a few of them are indeed generating electricity (like the Bandeirantes Landfill Gas to Energy Project, SÃ£o JoÃ£o Landfill Gas to Energy Project and Exploitation of the biogas from Controlled Landfill in Solid Waste Management Central â€“ CTRS / BR.040). Therefore, the project will have an enormous contribution over the integration with the electric sectors.Project start date: 03/05/2011This is the date of creation of Energas GeraÃ§Ã£o de Energia Ltda., composed by LimpebrÃ¡s ResÃ­duos Ltda. and Asja Brasil ServiÃ§os para o Meio Ambiente Ltda. exclusively for the development of the Project.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project involves the capture of biogas from the pig farmâ€™s wastewater treatment facility and the construction of a biogas generation plant to utilize the recovered biogas for electricity production. The project also involves the installation of wind turbines and solar PV. Currently, the biogas generation plant has an installed capacity of 65KW with another 195kw to be installed, for an installed capacity of 260KW. Currently, the solar PV system has an installed capacity of 963KW with another 490KW to be installed, for an installed capacity of 1,453KW.

Social and Environmental Benefits(1) Reduced methane emissions â€“ Methane-rich biogas is a byproduct of waste decomposition. In the absence of the project, GHG emissions in the form of methane would be released directly into the atmosphere. The project will prevent methane emissions by capturing the biogas associated with pig waste treatment. (2) Renewable energy generation â€“ The use of wind, solar, and biogas generated electricity neither creates water and air pollution not does it contribute to global climate change. Another benefit of domestic renewable energy is the decreased dependence on increasingly expensive imported fuel, most of which is highly polluting fossil fuel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the project activity, biomass is combusted in the boiler for producing high pressure steam to generate 20 MW electricity. The generation of electricity from project activity during this monitoring period is 340,743.434 MWh. The primary technology for the project activity is the direct combustion of rice husk, and power generation using the Rankine cycle technology. Power generation through this method involves the combustion of rice husk directly in the boiler, with the generation of steam, which is fed to a steam turbine that drives the generator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The applied technology is a ceramic water filter that produces water of safe drinking water quality which is further described in section A.5 below.Prior to the implementation of the proposed project, in the proposed project boundary there is limited access to clean drinking water. Lack of ready access to a water source also limit the quantity of suitable drinking water that is available to a household. Even if the water is obtained from an improved source, water that must be fetched from a source that is not readily accessible to the household and may be contaminated during transport or storage . Nationally, boiling water prior to drinking is the most common treatment method (70.1 percent of total population). The percentage of urban people and rural people boiling water is 60.0 percent and 80.1 percent, respectively . The baseline scenario is the continuation of current practice, thus identical to the existing scenario prior to the implementation of the proposed project.Under the project scenario, the proposed project will reduce GHG emissions by replacing the use of non-renewable biomass or fossil fuel to boil water to purify the water for drinking purposes. This purification method is energy intensive, creates indoor air pollution that is damaging to health, and emits significant GHG. Thus, the project activity contributes to the reduction in the GHG gas emissions associated to fossil fuel combustion for obtaining safe drinking water (SDW) as per conventional methods of water purification and also provides access to SDW to the consumers at an affordable price. The project activity will result in an annual average CO2 emission reduction of 37,277 tCO2e and 372,774 tCO2e over a 10 year crediting period.

The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lankaâ€™s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri. Several community service initiatives are being implemented by the project participant. Estimated project start date: 23/08/2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simoshi outsources institutional improved cook stoves (IICS) from the local manufacturer Ugastove and promotes and sells them to schools and institutions. The behavioural transformation Simoshi brings to schools through an effective management of change and subsequent support to the continuous use of the IICS enables both the participating schools and Simoshi to recycle a percentage of the stream of carbon credit returns, to further expand the number of schools that move up in the energy ladder._x000D_
Simoshi sells the IICS through payment schemes that include instalment modalities, allowing schools to comfortably pay back their debt throughout the school year, using the money saved from firewood NOT consumed to pay back for the acquired IICS. _x000D_
Simoshi's strong relationship of trust built with schools through monitoring, on-going staff training and free annual IICS maintenance, are the added on value and innovative project's pillars necessary for the behavioural transition to happen. IICS is a product that is prone to rapid deterioration if not maintained regularly. Nevertheless the annual free service provided to the IICS and the school is crucial in shaping future customer relations, product expectations and ultimately behavioural change. Schools face tremendous financial constrains and attention to the kitchen environment is the least of their priorities.

Biomass is often the predominant source of energy for cooking and water boiling, especially in rural areas. Cooking is generally carried out on thermally inefficient traditional devices and produces large amounts of smoke and indoor air pollution. The distribution of efficient cook stoves in this Programme will significantly reduce fuel consumption, resulting in an improved living environment for recipients and reduced pressure on local forests, with a reduction in fuel being burnt annually as a result of the project. By reducing fuel consumption, CO2 emissions from combustion of non-renewable biomass will be correspondingly reduced. In addition more than 1 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water and a high percentage these boil their water to purify it for consumption, taking significant amounts of fuel and time. In addition to distributing improved cook stoves, this PoA will also introduce safe water technologies such as boreholes. Clean water technologies avoid the need for water to be treated by boiling, equating to a reduction in CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass. Boreholes will either be newly installed or repaired and returned to working order but in all cases will be maintained throughout the project life time. Using the concept of suppressed demand, project developers can also obtain credits by supplying clean water to poorer members of society that are not able to use biomass energy to treat their water (usually because they cannot afford it, or because the energy is otherwise unavailable to them). This means that the credits obtained are proportional to the amount of biomass that would have been combusted using traditional technology in order to provide clean water for users. This concept allows for beneficiaries who would otherwise not benefit from the project to be included and supplied with a safe water source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result we planned to make use of the Clean Development Mechanism Gold Standard (GS) certification and project in order to promote improved cook stoves (SAVE 80), in the area of operation of SMARTD, i.e. in the entire district of Qachaâ€™s Nek and in the rural areas of Quthing and Mohaleâ€™s Hoek which are Seforong in the Quthing district, Hloahloeng, Sebaretlane, Qabanyane and Qabane in the Mohaleâ€™s Hoek district. The improved cook stove can be used by households, which are using mainly fuel wood as their source of fuel. The SAVE 80, stove set promoted by SMARTD contains a stainless steel stove, three cooking pots with lids and a heat retaining container/wonder cooker. This stove uses only small brittle sticks/twigs of wood to cook or boil water. It saves up to 80% of fuel wood compared to ordinary open fire way of cooking. This means that if you would need 1.5kg of wood to boil 6litres of water on an open fire, with SAVE 80 you would only need 0.3kg.The stove is suitable for cooking, frying and water heating. After reaching boiling point, food can be transferred to the wonder cooker where it will continue to simmer until it is well cooked. This further reduces wood consumption. Besides preventing greenhouse gas emissions, the objectives of the planned CDM Gold Standard programs are:â€¢To reduce wood consumption to a sustainable level so as to allow natural recovery of forests and/or reforestation to take place.â€¢To reduce soil erosion and protect the environment.â€¢To reduce indoor air pollution wood smoke and avoid its harmful health consequences.â€¢To reduce time for wood collection for households.â€¢To contribute to the prevention of wood resources so as to avoid inter-communal conflicts over resources.â€¢To empower participating women groups in villages by including them in project activities.â€¢To reduce vulnerability of households falling into poverty through decreasing fuel wood scarcity.Thanks to the income that will be generated through certification of the project under the Gold Standard, the high quality improved cook stoves can be sold at a reduced price to make them affordable to the average households.

Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewablesâ€™ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de lâ€™ElectricitÃ© et de lâ€™Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the countryâ€™s energy dependence vis-Ã -vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Moroccoâ€™s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the projectâ€™s contribution to Moroccoâ€™s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:â€¢Diversification of the national supply of energy;â€¢Project in line with the Moroccan governmentâ€™s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nationâ€™s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .â€¢Local development of renewable energy usage;â€¢Reduction of the countryâ€™s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;â€¢Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;â€¢Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;â€¢Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;â€¢Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the projectâ€™s operation phase.

The geographical coordinates of the central point of the Project is east longitude of 97Â°10'23.7"" and north latitude of 37Â°21'10.29"".The purpose of the Project is the generation of electricity from solar and the supply of this electricity to the Northwest China Power Grid (NWPG). The Project is to install and operate 128,400 solar cell modules with a capacity of 235Wp each. Therefore, the Project scenario is the installation of 30.174MWp of renewable energy power generation capacity, and the supply to the Grid of 48,084.39MWh (average value for the 25 operational years) of electricity generated from renewable energy. In accordance with the methodology there are no project emissions.In the baseline scenario, which is the same as the scenario existing prior to the implementation of the Project, the facilities, systems and equipment in operation are all power plants connected physically to the electricity system that the CDM project power plant is connected to.As NWPG is dominated by fossil fuel-fired power generation, the establishment of the Project will lead to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Following the methodology, the emission reductions are estimated to be on average 46,530 tones of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) per year, and 325,711tCO2e over the first 7-years crediting period.The Project start date: 05/07/2011 (The starting date of the Project is the date of the first contract.)The Project was successfully registered as CDM project (ref no.7962) on 02/11/2012, the additionality of the Project was fully demonstrated in the registered PDD and validated by the DOE, detailed information please refer to http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/BVQI1351691848.52/view.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project aims to improve upon the traditional cooking methods used at more than 500 institutions, benefiting upwards of half a million individuals, reducing approximately 50,000  tons of CO2 emissions per annum, and approximately 325,000 tons of CO2 emissions over the course of the 7-year crediting period.The IICS may be of different models and/or different sizes and will consume firewood. The different models and/or different sizes of IICS are either manufactured by the local stove manufacturer and project participant (PP) Virunga Engineering Works (u) Limited (VEW) or purchased from other manufacturers. As schools and institutions move up in the energy ladder, and fuel briquettes made of agricultural residues become available in Uganda, these IICS could also be used with such fuel briquettes in the future. In the case that a school/institution/IICS will use briquettes made of renewable biomass (agricultural residues and/or firewood from renewable plantations), the PP will ensure that no emission reduction credits will be claimed from the fuel switch from non-renewable to renewable biomass but only from the fuel savings resulting from the introduction of the IICS. The IICS are both portable as well as fixed built-in types, serving schools and other institutional users like prisons, plantation estates and hospitals. These IICS are more efficient in transferring heat to the saucepans, and as such, IICS require less biomass fuel to perform an equivalent cooking task when compared to the baseline technology. This increase in efficiency  translates directly to the  large scale fuel savings over the traditional stoves currently in use. By reducing fuel consumption, the project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the use of biomass fuels. This reduction in fuel consumption is estimated and corresponding CO2 emission reductions are calculated from these savings. The project activity shall initially deploy the VEW rocket stove IICS of 300 liters saucepan capacity to schools and institutions, but may distribute other saucepan capacities and/or models of IICS that meet the minimum thermal efficiency requirement of 20% later on.

The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations ComisiÃ³n EconÃ³mica para AmÃ©rica Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de LeÃ±a en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.",2500.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

This project involves the installation of six Horizontal Pit type full Kaplan turbines & generating units of 4 MW each to generate 24MW of power utilizing a rated head of 4.8m and a design discharge of 601.02m3 (Please refer to section A.4.3 for further technical details). _x000D_
The project activity is a Greenfield project planned on the Godavari River. Thus, the scenario existing prior to the implementation of this project activity would be to allow the potential energy in the flowing river to go untapped. In the absence of the project activity, any existing power demand in the region would be met by the continued operation of fossil fuel based power plants in the grid. Hydropower is a clean, renewable source of energy and does not contribute to air or water pollution or the emissions of greenhouse gases. The water after powering the turbines will be discharged back into the Godavari River through a tailrace canal, located within the river course close to the left bank open channel. _x000D_
The objective of the proposed project is to generate power from harnessing the water to meet the ever increasing demand for electricity in the Southern region of India.

This is avoided by collecting and treating the organic waste in a controlled composting facility. The composting process under controlled and aerobic conditions will maintain the biological process and therefore avoid methane emissions. _x000D_
The composting facility will be built on a 2 hectare area. The area is mostly paved and the whole area where the organic waste is kept for the first rotting process (controlled intensive rotting) is safely drained. This first process step takes about two weeks, after which the now fresh compost material is relocated to a maturation area.

These are areas with a large rural population mainly using wood-energy with traditional three stones cookstoves.More than 3,500 households will have the Wanrou efficient cookstoves, since this type of efficient cookstove has not encountered any socio-cultural adoption barriers in previous experiments in 58 villages in the department of Atacora. About 300 rural women will be trained and equipped as instructors for the construction of the Wanrou efficient cookstove in their villages and surroundings.The Wanrou efficient cookstoves represent an accessible solution to improve the energy efficiency of cooking and limit the overconsumption of wood-energy, and will gradually replace the traditional three stones cookstoves. By reducing the consumption of non-renewable biomass, the Wanrou efficient cookstoves will also contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions while preserving forests, ecosystems and biodiversity. These efficient cookstoves are a solution currently deployed in the region by Eco-Benin to combat energy poverty and use the potential for the generation of carbon credits. The use of the Wanrou efficient cookstoves with smoke exhaust chimneys also reduces the number of cases of respiratory diseases, reduces the time spent by women and children to collect firewood, and creates local jobs through the construction of the Wanrou efficient coosktoves. In addition to the promotion of the Wanrou stoves the project will deploy at least 8 solar kiosks and foresee 100 Wanrou cookstoves with a thermal electric generator which will allow to charge a mobile phone and/or LED lamp.

The PoA is a voluntary action with a goal of providing solutions that will reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with the use of non-renewable fuel from cooking at household levels. The use of non-renewable fuel such as wood and charcoal for cooking, leads to the emission of greenhouses gases, deforestation, and poor indoor climate. The programme will use several different technologies to reach this goal.  The solutions are based on two concepts that fall under the same CDM methodology: 	 _x000D_
1.	Reduce the need for boiling water for drinking and thus reduce the need for non-renewable fuel for boiling water. This is achieved by providing clean and safe drinking water to participating households. The purified water is provided either through_x000D_

The project is located at Jaisalmer district in the state of Rajasthan. The project will generate energy through renewable source i.e. wind. The kinetic energy of wind is converted into mechanical energy and subsequently into electrical energy. Kinetic energy which is carried by wind when passes through the blades of the WTG, is converted to mechanical energy which rotates the connected generator and which in turn produces the electricity. The electricity thus produced will be displacing the grid electricity which would have been otherwise generated through sources dominated by fossil fuel based power plants. The project activity thereby reduces the emission of green house gases which would have been generated from such fossil fuel based power plants. The electricity generation from the project activity will contribute to GHG reductions estimated at 11,568 t CO2e annually, while 115,680 t CO2e over period of 10 years. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
