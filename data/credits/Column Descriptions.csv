"PROJECTS 
Column",Column Header,   Details & Description,Data sourced directly from registry records
A,Project ID,The identification number given by the registries.,yes
B,Project Name,Name of the project on the registry.,yes
C,Voluntary Registry,The project registry that issues and tracks offset credits.,
D,ARB Project,"Compliance or Early Action = projects listed on the ARB's Issuance & Retirements table.
No = all other projects",
E,Voluntary Status,The status of the project on the voluntary market as designated by the registry.,yes
F,Scope,Each project falls under a scope according to the definitions in this document.,
G,Type,Each project is categorized by a type according to the definitions in this document.,
H,Reduction / Removal,"Each project type is categorized as: Reductions, Impermanent removals, Long-duration removals, or Mixed. Reductions make up the majority of credits to date and are projects that reduce the amount of emissions entering the atmosphere. Removals are project types that primarily draw carbon out of the atmosphere. Mixed are project types that can generate both emissions reductions and carbon removals; ACR separates some projects into their reduction and removal components (see column R of ACR Issuances tab). Projects that capture and sequester emissions from a smoke stack or other human activity are considered reductions, since they are effectively reducing emissions, except if the emissions are from a renewable source like renewable biomass, in which case the project is considered removals. ",
I,Methodology / Protocol,"Defines the eligibility, emissions calculations, and monitoring requirements for specific project types. They can be found at the links included on READ FIRST. Methodology is synonymous with protocol.",yes
J,Region,"Regions are defined in the World Regions tab. International shipping projects not registered in any particular country are categorized as ""International,"" as are projects spanning multiple countries.",
K,Country,"The country where the project takes place. Projects listed as ""International"" include emissions reductions from international shipping and projects taking place in multiple countries.",yes
L,State,The state or province where the project takes place.,yes
M,Project Site Location,Specific site / more detailed location of the project.,yes
N,Project Developer,"The person or organization responsible for developing the offset project. This is often the facility owner, project owner, or offset consultant.",yes
O,Total Credits Issued,"The total number of credits issued by the registry from the start of the project. Complete registry issuance tables can be found in the registry Issuances tabs. As of v6, issuance figures do not include buffer pool credits. Issuance figures also do not include Gold Standard planned emissions reductions (PERs) which are ex-ante credits representing expected future reductions. These are presented separately in column DE. Note that issued credit totals for VCS include all credits in a vintage if any credits of that vintage have been issued. This is different from how VCS reports issuances (please see the FAQ for a more detailed description).",
P,Total Credits Retired,"The total number of credits retired or canceled from the start of the project. Credits are marked as retired once an owner notifies the registry that credits are being used towards a compliance or voluntary emissions target. Once this happens, the credits can no longer be sold to another buyer. Details on retirements and cancellations, including credit serial numbers and sometimes the account holder retiring the credits, can be found in our registry Retirements tabs. Note that Gold Standard designates some credits as 'assigned.' Assigned credits indicate the intention to use the credit for offsetting claims in the future. Most of these credits are afforestation and reforestation projects issuing credits from future sequestration; we include assigned credits in the retirement tallies.",
Q,Total Credits Remaining,"The difference between credits issued and credits retired. Not all credits remaining are available for purchase, since some buyers may use them towards a climate commitment without notifying the registry or may be holding them for future use or resale. As of v6, buffer pool credits put aside by registries to cover the risk of reversals from forestry and other land use projects are excluded from this column.",
R,Buffer Pool,"All registries maintain a buffer pool of credits set aside as insurance against the risk that carbon offsets generated by projects that involve carbon storage, such as forests and grasslands, are released back into the atmosphere. For each project, the Buffer Pool column aggregates buffer pool credits deposited across all issuance years. Values take into account buffer pool adjustments, such as when credits are transitioned from registry to ARB with different quantities of credits issued or deposited into the ARB buffer pool and when buffer pool credits are returned to the reissuance pool. Credits used to cover reversals are not deducted from this buffer pool tally.",
S,Reversals Covered by Buffer Pool,Total buffer pool credits used in compensation for a reversal by the project.,
T,Reversals Not Covered by Buffer Pool,"Issued credits used in compensation for a reversal by the project. ARB, Gold, and Verra do not allow for the buffer pool to cover intentional reversals—losses caused by events under the control of the project proponent. All reversals listed in this column need to be replaced by the project proponent.",
U,First Year of Project,"The first year when credited reductions/removals occurred, marked by the end of the first reporting period.",
V-AW,Credits Issued by Vintage Year (reductions/removals occurring in: 1996 - 2023),"Credits issued by year when reductions/removals occurred, often called the vintage year. To see the year when credits are issued, refer to columns DO-EO. Issuances for ARB projects are calculated from registry and ARB issuances, except for VCS-ARB compliance projects sourced only from the ARB Issuances & Retirements table.",
AX-BY,Credits Retired in 1996 - 2023,"Credits retired/canceled by the retirement year. Retirements from ARB projects account for voluntary retirements listed in the registries as well as compliance retirements listed in ARB’s issuance table. ARB retirements occur in 2014, 2017, and 2020 for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd compliance periods respectively. The registry Retirements tabs may list who retired the credits.",
BZ,Credits Retired in Year Unknown,"Credits retired with no retirement date, including ARB compliance credits retired by Quebec and retired voluntarily, and Gold Standard credits recorded as assigned (for credits issued in future years that have not yet been fully verified).",
CA-DB,Credits remaining by vintage: 1996 - 2023,"Credits remaining and available in each issued vintage year. A few vintages have negative remaining values due to small discrepancies between their registry issuance, buffer pool, and retirement data.",
DC,Project Owner,"The organization, company, or individual who owns the offset project.",yes
DD,Offset Project Operator,"The organization, company, or individual which operates the offset project.",yes
DE,Authorized Project Designee,"The organization, company, or individual that has first right of refusal for credits issued.",yes
DF,Verifier,Each registry requires a certified third party to verify that the project complies with the requirements of the protocol and that the claimed reductions are monitored and reported as per the requirements of the protocol.,yes
DG,Estimated Annual Emissions Reductions,Some registries note the emissions reductions that the developer expects to produce annually as submitted in early project documents.,yes
DH,PERs (Credits Issued in Future Years),"Ex-ante credits, which are credits issued before the carbon emission reductions are realized. Reforestation and afforestation projects, for example, may sell credits for expected future tree growth.",
DI,Registry / ARB,"For filtering and sorting purposes, ARB projects listed on ARB Issuance & Retirements table are listed in this column as “ARB” rather than by the registry that initially issued the credits.",
DJ,ARB Project Detail,"Some projects from the ACR, CAR, and Verra registries are also registered as compliance offsets under the California Air Resources Board’s (ARB’s) offset program and can be used by California emitters to comply with the state’s cap-and-trade requirements. These projects use ARB-approved protocols.

DR-ES,Credits Issued in 1996 - 2023,"Credits issued by issuance year. To see the year when the credited reductions/removals occurred by reporting period (vintage), refer to columns V-AV. It can take two years or more between the end of a reporting period and the issuance of credits by the registries. CAR, ACR, Gold Standard, and ARB list issuances by reporting period. VCS lists credits by reporting period (Total Vintage Quantity) and separately by issuance date (Credits Quantity Issued) since credits for a single reporting period can be issued in multiple batches. To treat VCS issuances similarly to the other registries and give an accurate picture of credits remaining, these columns include all credits in a reporting period (Total Vintage Quantity) in the year that the credits first appear in the VCS database--the first date of credit issuance for each reporting period.",
